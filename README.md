# Orleans

A react project for learning and practicing react.

Since the project is a e-commerce shop, we took inspiration from Amazon and took the name "Orleans" whicsh is the largest
natural forest in France.

## setting up the environments for running the project locally

After cloning the project, cp the .env.template file and remove ".template".
The .env file is the environment setting file.

- PORT is the port you want the backend to run on.
- set NODE_ENV to "development".
- set MONGO_URI to the connection string of your database.
